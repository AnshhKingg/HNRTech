# Application Structure Instructions

The application structure is all about the optimized and encapsulated scenarios.

For Encapsulation we've :

> Bracketted Everything into the **/App** folder.

> In here we have **/Assets, /Config, /Redux, /Views and Routes**

> **Assets**: Consists of all the images and stylings

> **Config**: For Navigational configurations

> **Redux**: To store data (Contact List) in Local Storage

> **Routes**: To have the basic Routings (Add contact screen)

> **Views**: The basic screens

Most of the structures are maintained as *"Structured/Destructured"* manner.
